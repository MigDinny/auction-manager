NOTES (include bibliography):
	- psycopg is a Python DB API compliant library, therefore, when .execute() is called, a "begin transaction;" is called
		and awaits for .commit() or .rollback(). in this case, conn.autocommit = True

	- all queries, regardless of their atomicity, are encapsulated in a transaction, 

Questions:
	- psycopg always begins transactions, how not to begin transaction in a SELECT?

	- how do we END an auction at the given timestamp? 1) polling process? 2) any request checks if the auction is closed? 
		R: implement DATE checking in some requests | remove status from table


Decision-making (include bibliography):
	- token goes ALWAYS in request params (through link). it's not the best choice because of low security standards, though. anyways, it's very good for testing in the web-browser.
		the best choice is using cookies.
		why doesnt token go in body-params? well, that would work out in a POST request, but not quite in a GET request. technically it might work, but it stands against HTTP/1.1 standards.
		(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.3)

	- get requests with input trigger a specific feature in flask. /dbproj/leilao/{keyword} would go as described:

Tasks:
	XM - convert existing request to accept token through params
	XR - list all ON auctions
	XM - query ON auctions | variant for ALL auctions
	XR - query auction details 
	XR - list all auctions a user has activity // GET dbproj/meusleiloes
	R - bid on an auction // sends notification to previous bidder
	XM - edit auction properties (description, title)
	M - write message on an auction // delivers notification to all involving users
	R - list notifications
	- "término do leilao à hora" ????? check question
